### 1. INTRODUCTION 
In today's world, where environmental concerns and personal well-being are of utmost importance, there is a growing need for tools and applications that empower individuals to make informed decisions about their surroundings and take proactive steps toward a healthier lifestyle. One such area that directly affects both our environment and our well-being is the quality of the air we breathe and the plants that surround us. To address this need, we have developed an innovative mobile application that combines real-time air quality tracking, plant identification, disease diagnosis, and personalized plant care recommendations. This application aims to provide users with valuable insights and practical guidance to create a greener, healthier, and more sustainable environment.

### 2. PROBLEM STATEMENT
Air pollution has become a major concern in many cities around the world, leading to adverse effects on human health and the environment. Additionally, urbanization and limited access to green spaces have made it challenging for individuals to identify and care for the plants around them. Furthermore, novice gardeners often struggle with plant diseases and lack the knowledge required to provide adequate care to their plants.
To address these challenges, we have developed an app that combines multiple functionalities into one user-friendly platform. The app allows users to monitor real-time air quality in their vicinity, helping them make informed decisions about outdoor activities and protect their health. Furthermore, the app utilizes advanced image recognition technology to identify plants accurately, empowering users to learn more about the flora in their surroundings and foster a deeper connection with nature.
Moreover, the application offers a comprehensive plant disease diagnosis feature that utilizes machine learning algorithms to analyze images of affected plants and provide accurate identification of diseases. This enables users to take timely action to prevent further damage and save their plants. Additionally, the app provides personalized plant care recommendations based on factors such as plant type, location, and environmental conditions, ensuring that users can provide optimal care to their plants and promote their healthy growth.
By combining these features, our app aims to empower individuals to make informed decisions about their environment, nurture their green spaces, and enhance their overall well-being. Through real-time air quality tracking, plant identification, disease diagnosis, and personalized plant care recommendations, we believe that our application can contribute to a greener and healthier future for individuals and communities.
